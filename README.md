A Flutter plugin for sending and receiving MIDI messages between Flutter and physical and virtual MIDI devices.

Wraps CoreMIDI/android.media.midi/ALSA/win32 in a thin Dart/Flutter layer.
Includes a built-in typed MIDI parser/generator (`MidiMessageParser` and `MidiMessage.parse`); see [Message parser](#message-parser).

\** BLE MIDI on Web is not handled by `flutter_midi_command_ble`; Web MIDI exposure depends on browser/OS.


## To install

- Make sure your project is created with Kotlin and Swift support.
- Add `flutter_midi_command` to your `pubspec.yaml`.
- Add `flutter_midi_command_ble` only if you want BLE MIDI support.
- Minimum platform versions in this repo:
  - iOS: plugin package minimum is `11.0` (`packages/flutter_midi_command_darwin/ios/flutter_midi_command_darwin.podspec`), while the example app currently targets `13.0` (`example/ios/Podfile`).
  - macOS: plugin package minimum is `10.13` (`packages/flutter_midi_command_darwin/macos/flutter_midi_command_darwin.podspec`), while the example app currently targets `10.15` (`example/macos/Podfile`).
  - Android: plugin package minimum is `minSdkVersion(21)` (`packages/flutter_midi_command_android/android/build.gradle.kts`), while the example app currently uses `minSdkVersion(24)` (`example/android/app/build.gradle.kts`).
- If BLE is enabled on iOS, add `NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription` (and related Bluetooth/location keys as required by your BLE flow) to `Info.plist`.
- If using network MIDI on iOS, add `NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription`.
- On Linux, make sure ALSA is installed.
- On Web, use HTTPS and a browser with Web MIDI enabled (for example Chrome/Edge).

## Getting Started

The snippet below shows a practical integration pattern with optional BLE, device discovery, connection, and send/receive flow.

```dart
import 'dart:async';

import 'package:flutter_midi_command/flutter_midi_command.dart';
import 'package:flutter_midi_command/flutter_midi_command_messages.dart';
// Optional: remove this import and BLE setup if your app is serial-only.
import 'package:flutter_midi_command_ble/flutter_midi_command_ble.dart';

class MidiSessionController {
  MidiSessionController({required this.enableBle});

  final bool enableBle;
  final MidiCommand midi = MidiCommand();
  StreamSubscription<MidiDataReceivedEvent>? _rxSub;
  StreamSubscription<String>? _setupSub;
  MidiDevice? selectedDevice;

  Future<void> initialize() async {
    if (enableBle) {
      midi.configureBleTransport(UniversalBleMidiTransport());
      await midi.startBluetooth();
      await midi.waitUntilBluetoothIsInitialized();
      await midi.startScanningForBluetoothDevices();
    } else {
      midi.configureBleTransport(null);
      midi.configureTransportPolicy(
        const MidiTransportPolicy(
          excludedTransports: {MidiTransport.ble},
        ),
      );
    }

    _setupSub = midi.onMidiSetupChanged?.listen((_) async {
      final devices = await midi.devices ?? const <MidiDevice>[];
      if (devices.isNotEmpty && selectedDevice == null) {
        selectedDevice = devices.first;
      }
    });

    _rxSub = midi.onMidiDataReceived?.listen((event) {
      _handleIncomingMessage(
        event.device,
        event.transport,
        event.timestamp,
        event.message,
      );
    });
  }

  Future<void> connectFirstMatching(String query) async {
    final devices = await midi.devices ?? const <MidiDevice>[];
    final q = query.toLowerCase();
    final device = devices.firstWhere(
      (d) => d.name.toLowerCase().contains(q),
      orElse: () => throw StateError('No MIDI device found for "$query".'),
    );
    await midi.connectToDevice(device);
    selectedDevice = device;
  }

  void sendMiddleC() {
    final targetId = selectedDevice?.id;
    midi.sendData(
      NoteOnMessage(channel: 0, note: 60, velocity: 100).generateData(),
      deviceId: targetId,
    );
    Future<void>.delayed(const Duration(milliseconds: 200), () {
      midi.sendData(
        NoteOffMessage(channel: 0, note: 60, velocity: 0).generateData(),
        deviceId: targetId,
      );
    });
  }

  void _handleIncomingMessage(
    MidiDevice source,
    MidiTransport transport,
    int timestamp,
    MidiMessage message,
  ) {
    if (message is NoteOnMessage) {
      // Example: route to synth engine / UI.
      return;
    }
    if (message is CCMessage) {
      // Example: map controllers to parameters.
      return;
    }
    if (message is SysExMessage) {
      // Example: parse manufacturer-specific payload.
      return;
    }
    // Handle other typed messages as needed (PitchBendMessage, NRPN4Message, etc).
  }

  Future<void> dispose() async {
    await _rxSub?.cancel();
    await _setupSub?.cancel();
    if (enableBle) {
      midi.stopScanningForBluetoothDevices();
    }
    midi.dispose();
  }
}
```

`connectToDevice` completes when the connection is established, throws `StateError` on connection failure, and times out after 10 seconds by default.

See `example/` for a complete app with UI and transport toggles.

## Message parser

`onMidiDataReceived` already emits typed MIDI messages.
Use `MidiMessageParser` (or `MidiMessage.parse`) when you need to parse raw bytes from `onMidiPacketReceived` or from custom byte streams.
Keep one parser instance per input stream/device to preserve running-status and partial-message state correctly.

- Supports running status.
- Handles realtime bytes interleaved with channel and SysEx data.
- Reassembles split packets across callback boundaries.
- Recovers from malformed/incomplete byte sequences and resumes on the next valid status byte.

```dart
import 'dart:typed_data';

import 'package:flutter_midi_command/flutter_midi_command.dart';
import 'package:flutter_midi_command/flutter_midi_command_messages.dart';

final MidiMessageParser parser = MidiMessageParser();

void onPacket(MidiPacket packet) {
  final messages = parser.parse(packet.data, flushPendingNrpn: false);
  for (final message in messages) {
    if (message is NoteOnMessage) {
      print('NoteOn ch=${message.channel} note=${message.note} vel=${message.velocity}');
    } else if (message is PitchBendMessage) {
      print('Pitch bend ch=${message.channel} value=${message.bend}');
    } else if (message is NRPN4Message) {
      print('NRPN param=${message.parameter} value=${message.value}');
    } else if (message is SysExMessage) {
      print('SysEx bytes=${message.data.length}');
    }
  }
}

void onStreamClosed() {
  // Flush pending partial NRPN/RPN state, if any.
  final flushed = parser.parse(Uint8List(0), flushPendingNrpn: true);
  for (final message in flushed) {
    // Handle final pending message.
  }
  parser.reset();
}
```

For simple one-shot payloads you can also call:

```dart
final messages = MidiMessage.parse(packet.data);
```

### Dependency examples

With serial/native transports only:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_midi_command: ^1.0.0
```

With BLE support enabled:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_midi_command: ^1.0.0
  flutter_midi_command_ble: ^1.0.0
```

## Migration Guide (from older plugin versions)

### 1) BLE moved to an optional package

If you previously relied on built-in BLE behavior, add and attach the BLE transport explicitly:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_midi_command: ^1.0.0
  flutter_midi_command_ble: ^1.0.0
```

```dart
final midi = MidiCommand();
midi.configureBleTransport(UniversalBleMidiTransport());
```

If you want to remove BLE entirely, omit `flutter_midi_command_ble` and/or call:

```dart
midi.configureBleTransport(null);
```

For local workspace development (like this monorepo), `path:` dependencies are still valid and used by the example app.

### 2) Bluetooth API rename

- Old: `startBluetoothCentral()`
- New: `startBluetooth()`

`onBluetoothStateChanged` and `bluetoothState` are still available.

### 3) `MidiDevice.type` changed from `String` to enum

Use `MidiDeviceType` instead of string comparisons:

```dart
if (device.type == MidiDeviceType.ble) {
  // ...
}
```

If you still need old wire values for logging or compatibility, use `device.type.wireValue`.

### 4) Connection semantics are stricter

`await midi.connectToDevice(device)` now resolves only when connected (or throws on failure/timeout), so completion means a real connected state.

`MidiDevice` also exposes `onConnectionStateChanged` for reactive flows.

### 5) Transport policies are first-class

Use `MidiTransportPolicy` to enable/disable transports at runtime. Transport-specific calls throw `StateError` when that transport is disabled.

### 6) Host-paired Bluetooth MIDI devices may be native-routed

A host-native device can report `MidiDeviceType.ble` while still communicating through host MIDI APIs (for example paired CoreMIDI/Android host devices). Do not assume `type == ble` always means Dart BLE transport is used internally.

## Workspace and architecture

This repository is now managed as a melos monorepo.

### Packages

- `flutter_midi_command` (this package): public API and transport policies
- `packages/flutter_midi_command_platform_interface`: shared platform contracts
- `packages/flutter_midi_command_linux`: Linux serial MIDI wrapper
- `packages/flutter_midi_command_windows`: Windows serial MIDI wrapper
- `packages/flutter_midi_command_ble`: shared BLE MIDI transport using `universal_ble`
- `packages/flutter_midi_command_web`: browser Web MIDI transport
  See `packages/flutter_midi_command_web/README.md` for web-specific runtime/permission details.

### Transport policies

You can include/exclude transports at runtime:

```dart
final midi = MidiCommand();
midi.configureTransportPolicy(
  const MidiTransportPolicy(
    excludedTransports: {MidiTransport.ble},
  ),
);
```

When a transport is disabled, transport-specific calls throw a `StateError`.

### Device types

`MidiDevice.type` is now strongly typed as `MidiDeviceType` (for example `MidiDeviceType.serial`, `MidiDeviceType.ble`, `MidiDeviceType.virtual`).

### Device connection state

Each `MidiDevice` now exposes connection state updates:

```dart
final sub = selectedDevice.onConnectionStateChanged.listen((state) {
  // state is MidiConnectionState.disconnected/connecting/connected/disconnecting
});
```

### Compile-time BLE include/exclude

Direct BLE scan/connect is optional at dependency level:

- If you only depend on `flutter_midi_command`, no shared Dart BLE scanner/transport is attached.
- To include shared Dart BLE discovery/connection, add `flutter_midi_command_ble` and attach it to `MidiCommand`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_midi_command/flutter_midi_command.dart';
import 'package:flutter_midi_command_ble/flutter_midi_command_ble.dart';

final midi = MidiCommand();
midi.configureBleTransport(UniversalBleMidiTransport());
```

To disable BLE completely:

```dart
midi.configureBleTransport(null);
```

Note: paired Bluetooth MIDI devices exposed by host native MIDI APIs can still appear in `MidiCommand().devices` with `MidiDeviceType.ble` and connect through the native backend.

The normal BLE API remains unchanged:

```dart
await midi.startBluetooth();
await midi.startScanningForBluetoothDevices();
final state = midi.bluetoothState;
final stateStream = midi.onBluetoothStateChanged;
```

### Architecture note

`MidiCommandPlatform` now only describes native serial/host MIDI operations.
Shared BLE discovery/connection lives in `MidiBleTransport`, implemented in Dart (`flutter_midi_command_ble`).
Host-native backends may also report paired Bluetooth devices as `MidiDeviceType.ble`.
Web MIDI is implemented by `flutter_midi_command_web` using browser Web MIDI APIs.

### Native API contracts with Pigeon

Pigeon definitions are tracked in `pigeons/midi_api.dart` and should be used as the source-of-truth for generated host/flutter messaging code.
